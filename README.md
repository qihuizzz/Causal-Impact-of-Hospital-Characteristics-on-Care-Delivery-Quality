# 1. Problem Statement
Hospital quality has been identified as a major determinant of patient outcomes and a central focus of U.S. health policy reforms (Institute of Medicine, 2001; Zuckerman et al., 2016). It directly impacts clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation. However, estimating the true effect of hospital quality on healthcare outcomes is challenging due to potential endogeneity and the spatial uncertainty of hospital service areas. Therefore, **our key question is: Does higher hospital quality causally improve patient outcomes?**

# 2. Methodology
We use an instrumental variable (IV) strategy. Specifically, the distance to the nearest medical school, to causally estimate the impact of hospital quality on multiple hospital-level outcomes. To account for spatial uncertainty in defining hospital service areas, we implement and compare three geographic delineation methods: buffer zones, Voronoi polygons, and NHS-defined Hospital Service Areas (HSA).

**Specifically, we will implement three service-zone definitions to test robustness:**

**(1) Buffer-based Service Area (Main Model)**
- For each hospital, create 10-miles/15-miles/20-miles/25-miles/30-miles buffer zones
- Overlay with census & EMS data to construct hospital-level controls(Main analysis at hospital level)
- Robustness: Repeat on rural/urban hospitals only
**(2) Voronoi-based Service Area (Robustness Model)**
- Construct Voronoi polygons: each hospital "owns" the area nearest to it
- Overlay with census & EMS data (Also at the hospital level)
- Useful to address spatial distortion (e.g. overlapping buffers or MAUP)
**(3) Hospital Service Areas (HSA) ‚Äì Zone-Level Analysis**
- Use NHS-defined HSAs (each may contain multiple hospitals)
- Aggregate hospital quality/outcomes to the HSA level
- Match with HSA-level population data
- This version will inform policy-level recommendations:
    - Which HSAs have high health demand but few or poor-performing hospitals?
